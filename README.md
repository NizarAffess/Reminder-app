# ReminderApp
This is a simple Reminder App based on Brad Traversy's To-Do-List App.

Here's a live demo:  https://remind-me-app.netlify.app/

You can add reminders by filling a form then save it to html local storage so you can find your list of reminders whenever you check the page. There's a delete button as well.
It still needs some improvements like: sorting, edit reminders...
