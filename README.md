# ReminderApp
This is a simple Reminder App based on [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s [Bookmarker App](https://github.com/bradtraversy/bookmarker).

Here's a live [demo](https://remind-me-app.netlify.app/)

You can add reminders by filling a form then save it to html local storage so you can find your list of reminders whenever you check the page. A greetings message shows up once you open the app depending on your current time (morning, afternoon, evening). There's a delete button as well.
It still needs some improvements like: sorting, edit reminders...
